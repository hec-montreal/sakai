			<h3> Plagiarism </h3>
			<p>
				Students are expected to become informed of which actions are
				considered to be plagiarism or other academic violations at HEC
				Montréal, and of the applicable procedure and sanctions, which may
				include suspension or even expulsion from HEC Montréal. Violations
				are judged based on the facts and circumstances, and sanctions are
				applied accordingly. <a

					target="_blank">Learn more about plagiarism... </a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Cases of plagiarism are often caused by documented sources and in-text citations not being referenced correctly. You are invited to consult the guide <a href="http://libguides.hec.ca/citing" target="_blank">"Citing your sources"</a>, from the reference helpdesk of the HEC library. 
			</p>
			<h3> Calculators </h3>
			<p>Please consult the <a href="http://www.hec.ca/en/current_student/technologies/authorized_calculators/calculators.html" target="_blank">calculator
			usage policy</a> during exams when applicable.
			</p>
			<h3>Mutual aid during an individual work</h3>
			<p>It is the opinion of HEC Montreal that students engaging in discussion and collaboration for their individual
			 work or paper, is not only normal, but also desirable. These interactions contribute to the enrichment of the 
			 overall learning process.</p> 
			<p>However, there are certain types of communication between students that infringe upon the School’s rules and 
			regulations regarding plagiarism. Transmitting files, ongoing discussions resulting in an agreement on a set 
			process and the answer per se are considered as such infringements.</p>
