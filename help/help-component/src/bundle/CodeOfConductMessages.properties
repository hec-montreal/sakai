<h2 style\="text-decoration\: underline">CONSENT TO REMOTE LEARNING</h2>\
<ol>\
<li>The Government of Quebec has taken decisions and adopted decrees under the <i>Public Health Act</i> which limit or prohibit the presence of members of the university community in HEC Montr&eacute;al buildings.</li>\
<li>I accept that all courses for which I registered at HEC Montreal in the winter semester of 2021 may be given entirely remotely.</li>\
<li>I understand that the synchronous course sessions will take place during the time slot advertised in HEC en ligne, even if I am in a different time zone than Montreal.</li>\
<li>I understand that the exams will take place during the time slot advertised in HEC en ligne, even if I am in a different time zone than Montreal.</li>\
<li>I am able to meet the <a href="https://confluence.hec.ca/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=58789651" target="blank_">technological requirements</a> that will allow me to follow my courses remotely  and to complete my assessments remotely.</li>\
<li>I agree not to communicate links to my class sessions to others without the permission of the person giving the class.</li>\
<li>I acknowledge that members of the teaching staff may have access to the photograph which is in my student file. The members of the teaching staff will have to keep these photographs confidentially and use them only for identification purposes for their courses.</li>\
<li>I agree that the teaching staff, or a participant who has been authorized to do so, may record class sessions that I will attend. This recording will include video, audio, screen sharing and public chat. These recordings will be used for educational purposes only. I will turn off my microphone and my camera and intervene in writing if I do not want my picture or my voice to be found on the recording of a class.</li>\
<li>The teaching materials, recordings and videos to which I have access during my courses are protected by the <i>Copyright Act of Canada</i> (RSC (1985) c. C - 42).</li>\
<li>I undertake not to record the classes, not to copy or redistribute the teaching material, the recordings and the videos to which I have access within the framework of my lessons without the prior written consent of the person who gives the course.</li>\
<li>I understand that the <a href="https://www.hec.ca/direction_services/secretariat_general/juridique/reglements_politiques/documents/code_of_conduct_2014.pdf" target="blank_">Student Code of Conduct</a> also applies to remote learning. </li>\
<li>I agree that HEC Montr&eacute;al will take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the <a href="https://www.hec.ca/direction_services/secretariat_general/juridique/reglements_politiques/documents/REG_intellectual-integrity-students.pdf" target="blank_">Regulation respecting the intellectual integrity</a> of HEC Montr&eacute;al students during a distance assessment. To that end, I agree to install and use as directed a remote monitoring software on my PC upon request of a member of the HEC Montr&eacute;al teaching staff.</li>\
<li>I understand that HEC Montr&eacute;al may authorize limited access to its buildings and to the services offered therein in compliance with the rules applicable to the preservation of public health.</li>\
<li>If the proposed methods for remote learning do not suit me, I understand that I must cancel my registration in one or the other, or all of the courses to which I registered in the winter semester of 2021, with refund. </li>\
<li>The deadline for the cancellation with refund is May 8, 2021 for the majority of courses; however, it may vary from one course to the other. I must therefore check in my <a href="https://enligne.hec.ca" target="blank_">HEC en ligne</a> to find the deadline date that applies to each of my courses.</li>\
