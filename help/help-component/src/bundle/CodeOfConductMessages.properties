<p><h3>Article 4. Procedure</h3> </p>\
<p><h4>1) Immediate power of intervention </h4> </p>\
<p><h5>a. By an instructor </h5></p>\
<p >Instructors are in charge of ensuring a quality environment in their classes. In case of infringement of the requirements of this Code, the instructor may take immediate appropriate measures to restore a climate in class that favours learning. Before acting, the instructor must first specify the expected behaviour. If the situation is not corrected, the instructor may then ask the student(s) involved to leave the class, among other measures. In case of refusal, the instructor may request assistance from the HEC Montr&#233;al Security Department.</p>\
<p><h5>b. By any employee of HEC Montr&#233;al </h5></p>\
<p >In case of violation of the requirements of Article 3, any employee of the School may be asked to intervene. Employees may request assistance from their immediate supervisor or, in some cases, the HEC Montr&#233;al Security Department. </p>\
<p><h4>2) Power of intervention of the program director</h4> </p>\
<p >Any act that could be in violation of Article 2 can be reported to the Program Director of the student concerned.</p>\
<p >The Program Director may take appropriate measures to restore the learning climate in the class. However, the Program Director concerned must refer the file to the Legal Affairs department under the following section if he or she considers that suspension or permanent expulsion from the School are disciplinary measures that may be applied to one or more students. </p>\
<p >If the Program Director is the professor involved, the powers to intervene are delegated to the Director of Studies.</p>\
<p><h4>3) Power of intervention of the Conduct Committee </h4></p>\
<p >Any act that could be in violation of article 3 of the Student Code of Conduct must be reported to the Legal Affairs Department. </p>\
<p >The Legal Affairs Department will investigate and determine whether the case should be referred to the HEC Montr&#233;al; Student Conduct Committee. </p>\
<p >The Student Conduct Committee consists of the Secretary General, who acts as the Committee Chair and spokesperson, five HEC Montr&#233;al; students recommended by the committee of student association presidents and five staff members. The Committee members, aside from the Secretary General, are appointed by the Director, and serve terms of three years for staff members and one year for student members. </p>\
<p >When a case is referred to the Student Conduct Committee, the Secretary General strikes a subcommittee consisting of three or five members, i.e. the Secretary General and an equal number of students and staff members. </p>\
<p >The subcommittee must inform the student concerned of the actions or behaviour of which he or she is accused, and allow the student to speak on his or her own behalf. </p>\
<p >The Committee will decide on the appropriate sanction. Only a committee consisting of five members may recommend that a student be expelled.</p>\
<p >In all cases, the sanction must be appropriate to the nature of the offence, any previous offences and the specific circumstances of the case.</p>\
<p><h3>Article 5. Sanctions</h3></p>\
<p >The following disciplinary measures may be imposed for offences under the Code: </p>\
<p >a) <i>Warning:</i> A note is placed in the student\u2019s file, with no other immediate consequences;</p>\
<p >b) <i>Suspension:</i> The student may not enrol in courses or programs for a specified length of time as decided when the discipline is imposed, but not to exceed two years;</p>\
<p >c) <i>Permanent expulsion:</i> A student who is expelled from the School may not be admitted or readmitted to a program and may not enrol in any HEC Montr&#233;al; course or obtain marks, a diploma or a certificate. </p>\
<p >Aside from these disciplinary measures, the subcommittee may impose any other sanction it deems appropriate, including reimbursement for any damage caused or suspension of all access to the School\u2019s computer systems. </p>\
<p >In all cases, decisions regarding disciplinary measures will be placed in the student\u2019s academic file. </p>\
<p >This Code of Conduct was adopted by the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the committee of HEC Montr&#233;al; student association presidents.</p>\
